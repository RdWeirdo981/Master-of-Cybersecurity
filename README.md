# Master of Cybersecurity
My course projects of Master of Cybersecurity. I will always upload these assignment files after the end of a semester to avoid some integrity issues.

But please do not copy my codes in your assignments. The main reasons are as below:

1) Academic integrity!

2) I see this repo as an evolution of myself. You have to make your own path to your area.

3) The assignment specification changes every semester, so it's nonsense to copy my codes.

4) I didn't write well. In fact, look back to these codes, I see lots of problems. But they are still kind of some memories and experiences for me. I may have another projects to do and courses to take, so I can't optimize them.
